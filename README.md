**Modern PDF Pro** is a high-performance, privacy-focused PDF viewer for Visual Studio Code. It uses a modern WebAssembly (WASM) engine to render PDFs with speed and accuracy, supporting both Desktop and Web environments (GitHub Codespaces, vscode.dev).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **High Performance**: Powered by a custom WASM build of Google's PDFium engine. fast, efficient, and lightweight.
- **Web Ready**: Fully supported in **VS Code for Web** and **GitHub Codespaces**. We use intelligent data injection to bypass common browser CORS/permission issues.
- **Theme Sync**: Automatically adapts to your VS Code theme (Dark, Light, High Contrast).
- **Privacy First**: All rendering happens locally in your browser/webview. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Rich Tools**: Search, thumbnails, page navigation, and zoom.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

This extension differentiates itself from legacy viewers by using a modern stack:

1.  **Rendering Engine**: Uses `pdfium.wasm` (via `embed-pdf-viewer`), a compiled WebAssembly version of the industry-standard PDFium library. This ensures consistent rendering matching Google Chrome.
2.  **Web Workers**: Rendering tasks are offloaded to a Web Worker (`worker-engine.js`), keeping the VS Code UI thread responsive even with large documents.
3.  **Hybrid Loading Strategy**:
    - **Desktop**: Uses standard `vscode-resource:` URIs for efficient native file access.
    - **Web**: Uses a "Data Injection" fallback. The extension host reads the file into memory and streams it to the webview as a Blob URL, solving 401 Unauthorized errors common in browser-based VS Code.

## 📚 API for Developers

Other extensions can use Modern PDF Pro to preview PDFs.

```javascript
const extension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('chocolatedesue.modern-pdf-pro');
const api = await extension.activate();
// See docs/API.md for full usage
```
Refer to [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) for full documentation.
