## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-09

### Major Changes
- Replaced the legacy `pdf.js` implementation with `embed-pdf-viewer` for a modern, high-performance viewing experience.

### Added
- **WebAssembly (WASM) Engine**: Highly optimized PDF rendering.
- **Theme Synchronization**: Automatic switching between light and dark modes based on VS Code settings.
- **Enhanced UI**: Built-in sidebar for thumbnails/bookmarks, advanced zoom, and search functionality.
- **Robust Loading**: Adopted Blob URL loading and improved error handling for complex PDF files.
- **Security**: Implemented strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for the webview.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with large PDF files that were failing to render on canvas.
- Improved reliability for remote (SSH) development environments.

## [1.1.2] - 2024-2-13

API is released as a full version. **Important**: Obtaining the API works differently in this version than in `1.1.0`, so if for some reason you were already using this API you need to update it.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-12-19 (As pre-release)

Extension no longer needs the internet to load the worker.

An API is now available for other extensions to use to display PDF file previews.

## [1.0.4] - 2022-12-13

This is the initial release of the extension. PDF files are displayed as a series of images on canvases.
